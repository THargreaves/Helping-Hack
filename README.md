## Introduction

The Helping Hack Charity Hackathon is designed to be an inclusive event for anyone to attend, with the aim of giving back.
As such we have teamed up with the local Midlands-based charity, Heart of England, as well as working with our friends 
at Warwick Statistics Society to set up this exciting virtual event. This two-day hackathon involves talks, workshops 
and some thrilling competitions with great prizes on offer!

## Hackathon Overview

The hackathon consists of two main competitions. These will be released at the start of the hackathon on Friday 13th at 7pm
on the Teams Group, under the 'General' channel. Submissions should be a script with an accompanying report, and should
be submitted via the upload link found [here]().

## Heart of England

We are working with Heart of England, a charity that raises money to fund and develop local community activity across 
the West Midlands and Warwickshire. Since 1995, they have distributed over £16 million locally, benefitting an 
estimated 2 million people. 

In 2017/18 they awarded over £2.5 million to support communities across the West Midlands to thrive. Similarly, 
their endowment fund has also grown to £9.4 million, providing a continued legacy for communities.

Their amazing work helping communities inspired us to work with them on this hackathon. You can read more about the
projects they do [here](https://www.heartofenglandcf.co.uk/).
