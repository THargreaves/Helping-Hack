## Introduction
The Helping Hack Hackathon is designed to be an inclusive event for anyone to attend, with the aim of giving back.
As such we have teamed up with the local Midlands-based charity, Heart of England, as well as working with our friends 
at Warwick Statistics Society to set up this exciting virtual event. This two-day hackathon involves talks, workshops 
and some thrilling competitions with great prizes on offer!

## Heart of England

We are working with Heart of England, a charity that raises money to fund and develop local community activity across 
the West Midlands and Warwickshire. Since 1995, they have distributed over £16 million locally, benefitting an 
estimated 2 million people. 

In the 2017/18 they awarded over £2.5 million to support communities across the West 
Midlands to thrive. Similarly, their endowment fund has also grown to £9.4 million, providing a continued legacy 
for communities.

Their amazing work helping communities inspired us to work with them on this hackathon. You can read more about their 
amazing work [here](https://www.heartofenglandcf.co.uk/).

## Prizes and Sponsors
